# Yuzu Early Acess (Pineapple) Discord Bot
A Discord Bot that notifies the latest updates from Yuzu EA (Pineapple). Developed in Python.

Invite me to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1114600548499476590&permissions=8&scope=bot).

## How to set up the bot

1. Invite the bot.
2. Once the bot is invited, make sure it has the necessary permissions to be able to publish in a channel (by default and to avoid annoyances, I have set the bot to have administrator permissions). This way it will be able to publish in the channel without problems.
